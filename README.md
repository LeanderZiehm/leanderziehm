# Hi there 👋, I'm Leander Ziem!

## 🎓 About Me
I'm an AI student at the Technical University of Deggendorf, currently in my fifth semester and set to graduate in **2026**. I'm passionate about **generative AI** and **software development**, with plans to move to Berlin to dive into the vibrant startup scene.

## 💼 Leadership Experience
As the **Vice President of the Student Club** at my university, I lead our team in organizing weekly meetings, hosting guest lectures, and maintaining club activities. This role has helped me develop team management and organizational skills.

## 🔥 Interests & Skills
- **Generative AI for Marketing & Visuals**:  
  I work with models like **Stable Diffusion** for image generation and **OLLAMA** (LLAMA 3.2) for text generation. I’m also exploring **LLAVA (Vision LLAMA)** to analyze and interpret pictures and videos.

- **Software Development**:  
  I enjoy building custom workflow tools, primarily using **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Currently, I'm applying these skills in my internship, where I focus on optimizing workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Models**: Stable Diffusion, OLAMA, VLAMA

## 🌍 Fun Fact
I'm **21 years old** and a big fan of music. I enjoy listening to different genres, play a bit of piano, and even created my own **LED piano trainer** as a project! Using **Python**, I built a tool that reads MIDI files, converts them into LED signals, and lights up keys to guide my practice. It’s even smart enough to wait until I hit the right notes before showing the next part—currently helping me learn songs like "Für Elise."
